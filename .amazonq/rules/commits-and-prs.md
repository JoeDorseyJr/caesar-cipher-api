# Commit & Pull Request Rules

Adopt Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`) to describe intent in ≤72 characters. Include context or breaking-change notes in the body when relevant. Pull requests should link issues, summarise behavioural changes, and list the commands you ran (e.g., `bun test`). Provide screenshots or `curl` transcripts when an endpoint's response changes so reviewers can validate behaviour quickly.

## Commit Style
- Use Conventional Commits format
- Keep subject line ≤72 characters
- Reference requirement IDs (e.g., CC-ENC-001) in commits
- Include context in body when relevant
- Document breaking changes explicitly
