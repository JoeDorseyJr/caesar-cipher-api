# Findings & Follow-Up Checklist

- [x] Add an explicit task (Phase 1 or 5) to configure the `bun build` script and verify `bun build src/server.ts --outdir dist` produces deployable artifacts (covers TR-002, FR-005, OBJ-4).
- [x] Update Phase 1 configuration validation steps to include launching the server with a custom `PORT` value (e.g., `PORT=4000 bun run dev`) to prove TR-003 in practice.
- [x] Expand the Phase 3 performance benchmark task to specify latency targets for 1 kB payloads, concurrency ≥50, and record `/health` response timing (covers CC-HEALTH-002, NFR-001, NFR-002).
- [x] Extend the performance benchmarking (Phase 3 or 4) to measure authenticated vs. unauthenticated request latency, ensuring the auth overhead stays ≤10 ms (NFR-004).
- [x] Ensure documentation tasks capture environment variable definitions (`DATABASE_URL`, auth secrets) in README or supporting docs to fully satisfy TR-007 when new config is introduced.
- [x] Consider articulating Objective OBJ-4 as a testable acceptance criterion (e.g., “`bun build` outputs `dist/server.js` and README includes deployment notes”) for clearer validation.

No additional discrepancies identified after updates; continue to revisit this checklist if new requirements emerge.
